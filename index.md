I am a rising sophomore studying Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I joined the 
Taylor Group in June of 2017 in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship. 

## Current Projects

My research involves rapidly prototyping a variety of microstructures and templates to investigate the feasibility
of utilizing additive manufacturing in creating micro-swimmers and other micro-scale devices.
