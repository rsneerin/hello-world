Sentence or two about who you are and what your training has been (e.g. degrees)
I am a first year Master's student pursuing a Masters Research degree in Mechanical Engineering with a focus in nanotechnology. I also have a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis and a BSc in Engineering Physics and a minor in Mathematics from Randolph College. 

## Current Projects

My research involves interfacing bottom-up and top-down aprroaches of nano manufacturing pertaining to DNA origami. My current project involves investigating 2D scaffold based DNA nanostrcutres on soft substrates, such as silcon elastomers.

## Previous Projects
My previous research projects included the following:

- Micron-Fabricated UV Sensor Project
The project I was involved in was for the enhancement in the UV Response of Zinc Oxide Tetrapods using RF Sputtered Zinc Oxide Thin Films. 
I built the UV devices by using photolithography fabrication using Karl Suss MJB3 Mask Aligner, Oxford Plasma Lab 100 Inductively Coupled Plasma RIE and Kurt J. Lesker PVD 75 RF and DC Sputter Coater to construct UV sensor devices.
Finally, I assisted in the evaluation of the testing performance of UV sensors using Signatone S-1008 for IV curves based on 375 nm wavelength, signal enhancement vs voltage curve, and statistical comparison of before and after ZnO thin film.

- Assessing social and communicative deficits of mouse models of Fragile X Syndrome (Autism) and Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury through Ultrasonic Vocalizations
I assisted in the developement of the segmentation and analysis of ultrasonic vocalization algorithms using MATLAB programming. 
I also built and validated electronic circuity such as an amplifier gain for calibration of ultrasonic microphone and speakers. 
Finally, I was involved in assessing mouse models of pediatric traumatic brain injury and autism.
